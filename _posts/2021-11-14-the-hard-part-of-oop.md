I have started writing code using OOP in my years as a software engineer. 
Fews of the projects were successful, a ton of them failed to deliver values to business, 
all of them used OOP.

Among other reasons for failure, 
we failed to manage the complexity of the software that our team has built.
How did it happen?

In the common themes, our codebase was composing many 
objects together. The problem was more 
objects mean very hard to manage it relationship and the 
software failed when 
the development team failed to manage it. A picture for my words
